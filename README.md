## Introduction

This app is where you will store your Software Development Life Cycle Documentation. This application includes some common phases of software development: Project Initiation, Planning, Requirements (Analysis), Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. Each phase will have its own documentation. Each documentation will have its own files. Each file will have its own version. Each version will have its own content. Each content will have its own author. Each author will have its own name.

### note:
- I tried uploading files with the main server but it's not working because apollo/server v4 has an issue and restriction with file upload, so I created another server for uploading files.

- If apollo/server v4 fixes this issue, I will update this app.

## Core Features

-   Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) documentation for each phase of the software development life cycle.

-   Get a list of all documentation for each phase of the software development life cycle.

-   Get all files for each documentation.

-   Best practices for GraphQL API design.

-   Scalable folder structure for GraphQL API design.
